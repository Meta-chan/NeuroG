# Welcome to NeuroG!
NeuroG is ultra-light GPU-accelerated neuronal network.

### Dependencies
NeuroG depends on [Ironic Library](https://github.com/Meta-chan/ironic_library) and [MathG](https://github.com/Meta-chan/MathG).

### Platforms
Supports every platform supported by [MathG](https://github.com/Meta-chan/MathG). Potentially can work on every device that supports OpenGL API.

### Architecture
Simplest of simplest, multi-layer perceptron with tanh as activating function.

###### P.S. My code is not dirty, it is alternatively clean.
