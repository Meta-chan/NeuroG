/**@mainpage Welcome to NeuroG!
*NeuroG is ultra-light GPU-accelerated neuronal network. The architecture is simplest of simplest â€” a multi-layer perceptron with tanh as activating function.
*
*### Installation
*The installation process is integrated with [Ironic Library](https://github.com/Meta-chan/ironic_library), follow the link detailed explanation. But in a nutshell, you can do just this:
*@code{.cpp}
*#define IR_IMPLEMENT
*#include <neurog.h>
*@endcode
*
*### Dependencies
*NeuroG is fully based on [MathG](https://github.com/Meta-chan/MathG), so please follow the link to know more about installation, dependencies and platforms. Potentially NeuroG can work with minor changes on every device that supports OpenGL API \> 3.0.
*
*### Documentation
*The code is pretty self-documented. But more importantly, I provide [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/starting.html) documentation! It does not look too pretty since I am not an expert, but it is still quite informative. And of course, feel free to contact me!
*
*###### P.S. My code is not dirty, it is alternatively clean.*/
